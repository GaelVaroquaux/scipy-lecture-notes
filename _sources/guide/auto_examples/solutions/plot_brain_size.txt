Relating Gender and IQ
=======================

Going back to the brain size + IQ data, test if the VIQ of male and
female are different after removing the effect of brain size, height and
weight.

Notice that here 'Gender' is a categorical value. As it is a non-float
data type, statsmodels is able to automatically infer this.




.. code-block:: python

    import pandas
    from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

    data = pandas.read_csv('../brain_size.csv', sep=';', na_values='.')

    model = ols('VIQ ~ Gender + MRI_Count + Height', data).fit()
    print(model.summary())

    # Here, we don't need to define a contrast, as we are testing a single
    # coefficient of our model, and not a combination of coefficients.
    # However, defining a contrast, which would then be a 'unit contrast',
    # will give us the same results
    print(model.f_test([0, 1, 0, 0]))


Here we plot a scatter matrix to get intuitions on our results.
This goes beyond what was asked in the exercise



.. code-block:: python


    # This plotting is useful to get an intuitions on the relationships between
    # our different variables

    from pandas.tools import plotting
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Fill in the missing values for Height for plotting
    data['Height'].fillna(method='pad', inplace=True)

    # The parameter 'c' is passed to plt.scatter and will control the color
    # The same holds for parameters 'marker', 'alpha' and 'cmap', that
    # control respectively the type of marker used, their transparency and
    # the colormap
    plotting.scatter_matrix(data[['VIQ', 'MRI_Count', 'Height']],
                            c=(data['Gender'] == 'Female'), marker='o',
                            alpha=1, cmap='winter')

    fig = plt.gcf()
    fig.suptitle("blue: male, green: female", size=13)

    plt.show()
