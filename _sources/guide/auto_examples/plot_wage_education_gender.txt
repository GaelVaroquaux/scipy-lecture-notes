Test for an education/gender interaction in wages
==================================================

Wages depend mostly on education. Here we investigate how this dependence
is related to gender: not only does gender create an offset in wages, it
also seems that wages increase more with education for males than
females.

Does our data support this last hypothesis? We will test this using
statsmodels' formulas
(http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/stable/example_formulas.html).



Load and massage the data



.. code-block:: python

    import pandas

    import urllib
    import os

    if not os.path.exists('wages.txt'):
        # Download the file if it is not present
        urllib.urlretrieve('http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/CPS_85_Wages',
                           'wages.txt')

    # EDUCATION: Number of years of education
    # SEX: 1=Female, 0=Male
    # WAGE: Wage (dollars per hour)
    data = pandas.read_csv('wages.txt', skiprows=27, skipfooter=6, sep=None,
                           header=None, names=['education', 'gender', 'wage'],
                           usecols=[0, 2, 5],
                           )

    # Convert genders to strings (this is particulary useful so that the
    # statsmodels formulas detects that gender is a categorical variable)
    import numpy as np
    data['gender'] = np.choose(data.gender, ['male', 'female'])

    # Log-transform the wages, because they typically are increased with
    # multiplicative factors
    data['wage'] = np.log10(data['wage'])



simple plotting



.. code-block:: python

    import seaborn

    # Plot 2 linear fits for male and female.
    seaborn.lmplot(y='wage', x='education', hue='gender', data=data)



statistical analysis



.. code-block:: python

    import statsmodels.formula.api as sm

    # Note that this model is not the plot displayed above: it is one
    # joined model for male and female, not separate models for male and
    # female. The reason is that a single model enables statistical testing
    result = sm.ols(formula='wage ~ education + gender', data=data).fit()
    print(result.summary())



The plots above highlight that there is not only a different offset in
wage but also a different slope

We need to model this using an interaction



.. code-block:: python

    result = sm.ols(formula='wage ~ education + gender + education * gender',
                    data=data).fit()
    print(result.summary())



Looking at the p-value of the interaction of gender and education, the
data does not support the hypothesis that education benefits males
more than female (p-value > 0.05).
